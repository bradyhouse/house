As a Web developer, much of my time is spent researching and attempting to master different frameworks.
I have developed this repo in an attempt to capture this research. My thinking (hope) is driven by
the adage _if everything begins in the house, then (perhaps) the "house always wins"._ At the same time, to
learn _anything_, I am someone who has to build _something_.  The link:scripts/fiddle.sh[fiddle.sh] script is that thing.
Essentially, it is Command Line Interface (CLI) for quickly getting started with over 25 different languages and
libraries.  At present, it can be used to create a localized sandbox (aka _fiddle_) for any of the following languages
and frameworks:
