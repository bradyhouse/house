### Issue

[Issue #723](https://github.com/bradyhouse/house/issues/723)


### Description

Based on my current professional focus (in March 2023), I need a way to quickly spin-up a new vue (ts or js) fiddle.  To accomodate this support, fiddle.sh needs to be enhanced to support vue fiddles.  This bash based fiddle is a POC, which models the enhancement.
