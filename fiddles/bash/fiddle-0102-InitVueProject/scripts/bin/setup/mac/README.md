This folder contains a collection of _sub-scripts_ used to setup applications and libraries required by the `fiddle.sh` 
script when run on the Mac OS platform.  Each `*.sh` file contain functions referenced (or "sourced") by the [_setup.sh](../_setup.sh) 
script in the parent root directory. The `_*` prefix is a convention meant to indicate that the file cannot be executed
directly.
