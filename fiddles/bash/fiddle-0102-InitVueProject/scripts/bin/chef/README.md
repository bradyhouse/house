chef
=====

Bash script file used to create and/or manage the [chef](../../../fiddles/chef) fiddles collection.  
Each `*.sh` file in this directory contain functions referenced (or `sourced`) by one more scripts 
in the parent [scripts](../..) directory.  In other words, each file is simply a grouping of related 
functions.  The `_*` prefix is a convention meant to indicate that the file cannot be executed directly.
