bin
=====

In Unix land, "bin" stands for "binaries".  Such directories usually contain certain fundamental utilities, such as ls or cp
([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_filesystem#Conventional_directory_layout)). In this case, it contains
"fundamental" utilities referenced (or consumed) by scripts residing in the parent scripts directory.  If a particular script
requires input parameters, these parameters can be determined by running the script without any parameters.  By convention,
all scripts requiring input parameters display usage details when no parameters are passed.
