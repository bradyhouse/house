React (index)
======

Executing the command `fiddle "index" "react"` produces the following output.

    {{ ʕ・ɭ・ʔ }}
    
    FIDDLE-INDEX.SH

    Done. All "react" fiddles have been re-indexed.



This command rebuilds the [dist/index.html](dist/index.html) page based on the react fiddles that have been built and 
added to the root [dist](dist) directory.  Provided the fiddle is not listed in the [.gitignore](../../.gitignore) 
file and includes a root `index.html` file, then a link to dist version of the fiddle is added to the page. For 
additional information regarding the build process, see the [build info and details page](build.md).
