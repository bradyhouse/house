### Title

React Create App (Template = TypeScript)


### Creation Date

08-13-22


### Location

Chicago, IL 60640


### Issue

[Issue 420](https://github.com/bradyhouse/house/issues/420)


### Description

Based on my current professional focus (in August 2022), I need a way to quickly spin-up a new react / typescript fiddle.  To accomodate this support, the
existing create react command should en hanced to support an optional template variable.  This bash based fiddle is a POC, which models the 
enhancement.
