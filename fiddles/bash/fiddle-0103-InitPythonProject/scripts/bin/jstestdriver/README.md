jstestdriver
=====

Collection of _sub-scripts_ used to automate the testing of [fiddles](../../../fiddle) that support use of the jstestdriver.
Each `*.sh` file contain functions referenced (or "sourced") by one more scripts in the parent [scripts](../..)
directory.  In other words, each file is simply a grouping of related functions.  The `_*` prefix is
a convention meant to indicate that the file cannot be executed directly.
