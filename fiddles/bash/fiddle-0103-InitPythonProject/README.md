======

I increasingly need to prototype (aka fiddle) in Python. However fiddle.sh's support for python  
is antiquated. A python fiddle needs to start with a virtual environment and a Pipfile.  The     
README.md should specify how install / setup and extend things. To workout and test this         
configuration a bash fiddle is in order.  As a starting point, see                               
https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/index.html.
