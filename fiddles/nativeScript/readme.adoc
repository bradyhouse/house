= NativeScript

NativeScript is a framework for developing cross-platform mobile apps using JavaScript.  This directory is dedicated
to exploration of this framework.  Each directory corresponds to separate mobile app.  The `fiddle.sh` script
can be used to extend or test drive this collection. The following table outlines how.

== Envrionment Setup (Mac OS X)

=== Android

==== Mac OS

1. Install homebrew. Navigate to the root scripts directory and run the following command:

    ./fiddle.sh setup mac brew

2. Go to Java SE Downloads and click Download for JDK.
3. In the Java SE Development Kit section, accept the license agreement and click the download link for Mac OS X.
4. Wait for the download to complete and install the JDK.
5. In your `~/.bashrc` file, set the JAVA_HOME system environment variable.
    `export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home)`
6. In the terminal, run the following command
    `brew cask install android-sdk`
7. In the terminal, run the following command
    `android update sdk --filter tools,platform-tools,android-23,build-tools-23.0.3,extra-android-m2repository,extra-google-m2repository,extra-android-support --all --no-ui`
8. In the terminal, run the following command
    `brew info android`
9. Add the `export ANDROID_HOME=...` statement to your .bashrc file
10. In the terminal, run the following command
    `android avd`
11. In the `Android Virtual Device (AVD) Manager`, create an Android Virtual Device, called `fiddler`
12. To test your android configuration, use the link:start.md[fiddle.sh start ...] command

=== Node.js

1. Install Node.js v6.x. In the terminal, run the following command
    `brew install homebrew/versions/node6-lts`

=== NativeScript CLI

1. In the terminal run the following command
    `npm i -g nativescript'
2. Exit the terminal and restart
3. To check if your system is configured properly, in the terminal run the following command
    `tns doctor`

== Machine Specific Configuration

Use the link:../../scripts/bin/nativescript/.nativescriptrc[scripts/bin/nativescript/.nativescriptrc] file to configure machine specific variables.

== Enabling Angular2 Templating

`fiddle.sh` includes logic to initialize new nativeScript fiddles using _just JavaScript_ or Angular2 (aka _transpiled typeScript_)
By default, JavaScript is enabled. This means, fiddles are initialized using the `nativescript create ...` command.
In my experience, this approach is faster and cleaner. That said, if you want get your feet wet with Angular2 and typeScript,
then you will need to complete the following steps:

1. Open the link:../../scripts/bin/nativescript/.nativescriptrc[scripts/bin/nativescript/.nativescriptrc] file
2. Change the `__TEMPLATE_TYPE__` variable from `js` to `ng2`

Once this change is made, `fiddle.sh` will initialize new nativeScript fiddles using Angular2 and Typescript.  To learn
more nativescript and its CLI, enter the command `tns` => tns.md[tns.md].
