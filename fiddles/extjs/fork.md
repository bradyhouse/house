ExtJS 6 (fork)
======

Executing the command `fiddle "fork" "extjs6" "0000" "fiddle-0100-Fork"` produces the following output.

    {{ ʕ・ɭ・ʔ }}
    
    FIDDLE-FORK.SH
    FIDDLE-INDEX.SH
    12-19-18
    Done. All "extjs6" fiddles have been re-indexed.
    Done. The "../../fiddles/extjs6/fiddle-0100-Fork" directory has been initialized.
    FIDDLE-INDEX.SH
    12-19-18
    Done. All "extjs6" fiddles have been re-indexed.
    

Note, when a `extjs6` fiddle is `forked`, the `fiddle.sh index extjs6` command is automatically initiated. This command
rebuilds the collection's root [index.html](index.html) file so that includes a reference to the newly 
added fiddle. In addition, it handles appending a new line for the fiddle to the master [CHANGELOG.MD](../../CHANGELOG.md) file.
