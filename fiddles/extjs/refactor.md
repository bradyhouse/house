ExtJS 6 (refactor)
======

Executing the command `fiddle "refactor" "extjs6" "0000" "fiddle-0100-Refactor"` produces the following output.

      {{ ʕ・ɭ・ʔ }}
      
      FIDDLE-REFACTOR.SH
      FIDDLE-INDEX.SH
      12-19-18
      Done. All "extjs6" fiddles have been re-indexed.
      Refactor process completed successfully.
      "fiddle-0000-Template" is now "fiddle-0100-Refactor".
      

Note, when an `extjs6` fiddle is `refactored`, the `fiddle.sh index extjs6` command is automatically initiated.  This 
command will add a reference to the fiddle to the root angular [index.html](index.html) page.
