= ExtJS 6

Before you can build a website using ExtJS, you have to understand ExtJS.  Based on books, research, and trial and
error, the best approach I have found is link:https://fiddle.sencha.com/#home[Sencha Fiddle].  If I am unfamiliar with or
(simply) donâ€™t understand a specific piece of the framework, then step one is to build and publish a fiddle (or fiddles)
until it makes sense.  This directory is dedicated to exploration of this framework.  The `fiddle.sh` script can be used
to extend or test drive this collection. The following table outlines how.

== Installation

Complete the link:https://github.com/bradyhouse/house/wiki/Setup-(Mac-OS)[Setup (Mac OS)] procedure. Open a terminal
window and run the command `fiddle setup mac js-beautify`. The setup command simply installs js-beautify, which
is required by the combine command (see below).
