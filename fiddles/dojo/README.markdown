dojo
=====

Before you can build a website using the [Dojo toolkit](http://dojotoolkit.org/api/), you have to understand the toolkit.  Based on books, research, and trial and error, the best approach I have found is [js fiddle] (http://jsfiddle.net/).  
If I am unfamiliar with or (simply) don’t understand a specific piece of the framework, then step one is to build and publish a fiddle (or fiddles) until it makes sense.  
Each of the following sub-directories corresponds to stand alone application that *fiddles* with a specific piece of the Dojo framework.
