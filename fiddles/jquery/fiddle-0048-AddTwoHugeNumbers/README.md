### Description

Fiddle exploring the solution to the [Code Fight AddTwoHugeNumbers Problem](https://codefights.com/interview-practice/task/RvDFbsNC3Xn7pnQfH):

    You're given 2 huge integers represented by linked lists. Each linked list element is a number from 0 to 9999 that represents a number with exactly 4 digits. The represented number might have leading zeros. Your task is to add up these huge integers and return the result in the same format.
    
    Example
    
    For a = [9876, 5432, 1999] and b = [1, 8001], the output should be
    addTwoHugeNumbers(a, b) = [9876, 5434, 0].
    
    Explanation: 987654321999 + 18001 = 987654340000.
    
    For a = [123, 4, 5] and b = [100, 100, 100], the output should be
    addTwoHugeNumbers(a, b) = [223, 104, 105].
    
    Explanation: 12300040005 + 10001000100 = 22301040105.
