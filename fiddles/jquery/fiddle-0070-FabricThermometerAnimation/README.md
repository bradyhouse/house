Fabric.js Thermometer with Configurable Image Meniscus


### Creation Date

### Location

Chicago, IL


### Issue

[Issue 255](https://github.com/bradyhouse/house/issues/255)


### Description

I need a canvas based fund raising thermometer control, that can become the basis of a Custom Jive Tile.  
The thermometer should include a configurable Goal and Donation inputs as well as image based meniscus that
can be replaced with a different image. Essentially, this fiddle should build on [fiddle-0063-FabricThermometer](../fiddle-0063-FabricThermometer).
