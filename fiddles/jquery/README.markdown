Before you can build something with jQuery and twitter bootstrap, you have to understand jQuery and twitter bootstrap.  Based on books, research, and trial and error, the best approach I have found is [jsFiddle] (https://jsfiddle.net).  If I am unfamiliar with or (simply) don’t understand a specific piece of these frameworks, then step one is to build and publish a fiddle (or fiddles) until it makes sense.  Each of the following sub-directories corresponds to stand alone application that *fiddles* with a specific piece (or pieces) of these frameworks.
