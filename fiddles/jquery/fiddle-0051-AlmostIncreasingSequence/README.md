### Issue

[Issue 178](https://github.com/bradyhouse/house/issues/178)

### Description

Fiddle exploring the solution to the [Code Fight AlmostIncreasingSequence Problem](https://codefights.com/arcade/intro/level-2/2mxbGwLzvkTCKAJMG):

    Given a sequence of integers as an array, determine whether it is possible to obtain a strictly increasing sequence by removing no more than one element from the array.
    
    Example
    
    For sequence = [1, 3, 2, 1], the output should be
    almostIncreasingSequence(sequence) = false;
    
    There is no one element in this array that can be removed in order to get a strictly increasing sequence.
    
    For sequence = [1, 3, 2], the output should be
    almostIncreasingSequence(sequence) = true.
    
    You can remove 3 from the array to get the strictly increasing sequence [1, 2]. Alternately, you can remove 2 to get the strictly increasing sequence [1, 3].
