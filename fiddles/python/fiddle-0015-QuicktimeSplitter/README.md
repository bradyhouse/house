fiddle-0015-QuicktimeSplitter
======

Suddenly, due unplanned professional circumstances, we have to sell our house.  The realtor needs pics for the listing. All we have is a set of quicktime (aka iphone recorded) videos that were created upon its purchase. I need to determine if I can use python to split the quicktime files into individual jpeg frames.
