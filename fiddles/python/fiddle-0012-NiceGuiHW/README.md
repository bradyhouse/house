fiddle-0012-NiceGuiHW
======

Nice GUI is an "interesting" framework. It provides both AgGrid and Plotly chart integration. The question is, how do you add other Node Package support and if possible is the workflow "scaleable". I need a fiddle exploring how to extend Nice GUI with a custom Alitair Chart (aka Vega Embed) component. The component should render something similar to [Vue Fiddle 1](https://bradyhouse.github.io/vue/fiddle-0001-VegaMarkerCustomEventJs/).
