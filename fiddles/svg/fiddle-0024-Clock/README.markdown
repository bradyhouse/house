### Title

SVG Analog Clock


### Creation Date

### Description

Fiddle exploring how to create a re-useable analog clock component using ES6 classes that is rendered in SVG instead of HTML. The component utilizes a design pattern similar to EXTJS complete with controller style mixins in order to organize (sub-divide) the various event handlers.  The inner working of the clock is based on the [ball clock SVG](http://srufaculty.sru.edu/david.dailey/svg/ballclock.svg) by David Dailey.  Finally, it builds on the "toolkit" collection of SVG wrapper classes created in [fiddle-0019-Button](../fiddle-0019-Button).
