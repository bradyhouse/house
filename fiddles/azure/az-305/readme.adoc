= Amazon Web Services

I finally finished my bachelor's degree in 2015.  At 40 I graduated Cum Laude from the Illinois Institute of
Technology's Information and Technology Management program.  The achievement took nearly eight years of
my life and cost over 80K.  In hindsight, I wish I would have just spent that time (and money) studying and
mastering AWS.  Anyway, life goes on and here we are--making-up for lost time. This directory is
dedicated to my notes and `fiddles` involving AWS.  At the outset, this just means markdown files written
while watching lectures/labs on link:https://github.com/ACloudGuru[acloud.guru]. Note, aside from purchasing the
`AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate` course on cloud guru, all of my studies have been
done using an link:https://aws.amazon.com/free/[AWS free tier account].


=== Flash Card Indicator

In the list below, some lectures (and labs) fall into the category of __just memorize it__.  To highlight this
distinction the markdown file link is designated with the image:https://i.imgur.com/torRcHV.png["Just Memorize Indicator",width=20] emoji.
This means that my notes include an additional `iFlash Card` formatted file based on the material covered. These files
can be imported the into the `iFlash Card` desktop App and then published to an iphone or ipad for `on-the-go` review.
For more information see the xref:flash-card-strategy[Flash Card Strategy Section] below.

== Flash Card Strategy

AWS certification in many ways, is like a _god-awful_ college biology class. You gotta memorize some things cold. __What to do?__ In my
experience, (a) some nicotine to improve your memory and (b) __flash cards__.  Fortunately, today there is an App for
that-- __iFlash__ Desktop App and it's companion mobile app __iFlash Touch__.

anchor:iFlash-Desktop-App[]

==== iFlash Desktop App


image::http://i.imgur.com/QRsMRfp.png[link="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/iflash/id409123835?mt=12"]


Purchase (15$) and install this app on your Mac Desktop.

==== iFlash Mobile App


image::http://i.imgur.com/QRsMRfp.png[link="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/iflash-touch/id313198123?mt=8"]


Download and install this free app on your target iphone or ipad.


anchor:the-study-workflow[]

=== The Study WorkFlow

At the end of each lecture/lab note markdown page designated with the image:https://i.imgur.com/torRcHV.png["Just Memorize Indicator",width=16] emoji (above),
I have published a text formatted version of my __Review Questions and Answers__ for the material covered. These files use the iFlash Card import format. Each file can
be imported into the iFlash Mac desktop app as a __Card Deck__. The deck can then pushed to your Ipad or Iphone
using the __iFlash Touch__ app. Using this approach, the __Study Workflow__ then becomes:

1.  Watch/Complete an acloud.guru lectures/lab
2.  Using your Mac, import the review questions and answers into the __iFlash Desktop App__
3.  Launch the __iFlash Touch App__ on your iphone (or ipad)
4.  Push questions from the Desktop to the mobile Device
4.  Use the cards to memorize the material covered


anchor:one-deck-to-rule-them-all[]

=== One Deck to Rule Them All

In case you find downloading, importing and exporting each of the flashcard decks (above) a bit tedious, here is the
complete collection combined into one massive, categorized deck of 650+ flash cards.  This is the deck I used going into
the Exam.  Additionally, it includes some of the more extraneous questions included in the Acloud Guru `Mini Exam` as
well as the `Exam Simulator`.
