= Angular2 CLI

_Angular?_ No, now its: _Angular2!_  Its ubiquitous.  Unfortunately, as I have found over the last few weeks ( _months_ )
working with the framework (see the link:../Angular2[Angular2 collection]), there is obstacle to entry-- _tooling_.

Creating an Angular2 app doesn't begin with a story board (or idea).  It begins with _tooling_.  It begins with deciding how your
code base will go from typescript to transpiled javascript.  The link:https://cli.angular.io/[Angular Cmd Line Interface], which by
the way _smells_ alot like link:http://docs.sencha.com/cmd/5.x/intro_to_cmd.html[Sencha Cmd], is meant to alleviate this
pain (or delay) of entry.  This collection is aimed at my exploration and study of this new tool.  The `fiddle.sh` script
can be used to extend or test drive this collection. The following table outlines how.
