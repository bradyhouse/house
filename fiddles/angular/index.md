    Done. All "angular-cli" fiddles have been re-indexed.


This command rebuilds the [dist/index.html](dist/index.html) page based on the angular2 cli fiddles that
have been built and added to the root [dist](dist) directory.  Provided the fiddle is not listed in the [.gitignore](../../.gitignore) 
file and includes a root `index.html` file, then a link to dist version of the fiddle is added to the page. For additional 
information regarding the build process, see the [build info and details page](build.md).
