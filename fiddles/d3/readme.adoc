As a starting point, I will work through the examples outlined by Nick Qi Zhu in the book **Data Visualization with D3.js Cookbook**.
The link:https://github.com/NickQiZhu/d3-cookbook[source code] from this book is sub-moduled in the link:libs/d3-cookbook[libs/d3-cookbook]
directory. To pull-down this secondary code base, simply run `git submodule update` command. Finally, the links listed
below are taken from the aforementioned text.
